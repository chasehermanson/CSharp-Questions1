# CSharp-Questions1

1.	Q: What is a namespace?	
	A namespace allows you to be able to organize your code. You can organize them as you please, usually going from general names and getting more specific as you go down. This also allows you to structure the project into pieces to help with organization.
	
2.	Q: What are value types?
	Int, float and bool are some examples of value types. When a value type is created a memory space is also created so it can store the value.
  
3.	Q: What are reference types?
	Reference types store references to their data, unlike the value types that 	store the data directly. So it stores the address where the value is being 	stored.

4.	Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
	Automatic Properties are used to simplify code when no additional logic is required. It is a way to take lengthy code and write it in a shorter version and get the same result. It is useful because they are essentially coding shortcuts.
  
5.	Q: What is the purpose of using statement?
	The using statement is used to make sure that the object is dismissed as soon as it goes out of scope. The using statement ensures that it is gone so there is no need additional code.

6.	Q: What are dynamic type variables?
	The dynamic type allows you to perform an operation and it will be 	resolved at run time. This means errors can be caught earlier. It is useful 	when coding using reflection or dynamic language because it requires 	less code.

7.	Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
	The is operator is used to evaluate compatibility at the run time. It is 	checking to see if the type of an object with a given type. It is checking to 	see if the type of object is what we wanted.

8.	Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
	Generics are techniques of writing the code for a class without specifying 	the type. This allows for faster use rather than using objects where you 	have to locate the value.

9.	Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?
	A public member can be used by anyone.

10.	Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
	Yes, a function can do more than one argument but it can only return one argument. 
  
11.	Q: How do you sort an array?
I can sort an array by using Array.Sort() in C#/

12.	Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
	Nullable types can set empty values to data in order to get it to run.
  
13.	Q: What is an enumeration?
	Enumeration provides a faster way to define a set of named intergral constants that also may be assigned to another variable. It gives a name to each constant so it can be looked up using that.


14.	Q: What is inheritance?
	Inheritance is when you can create a class that inherits the behaviors of 	an exisiting class. It is also one of the key features when it comes to 	object oriented programming.

15.	Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?
	No. You can only inherit one class in C#, multiple is not allowed.

16.	Q: What is the purpose of as operator?
	It allows for calculations to be done that otherwise could not be achieved.
  
17.	Q: What is an object? An object is block of memory that has been made according to the code. Objects can also be stored in either a variable, in an array or collection.

18.	Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?
	Unless otherwise specified, members of a struct are public, and members 	of a class are private. Structs are value type and classes are reference 	type.
  
19.	Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?
	Break causes the loop to be stopped immediately while continue causes 	the next iteration of the loop to start.



20.	Q: What is this and how is it used?
	It could be used to reference the current instance of the class.
  
21.	Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?
	They are used to find exceptions that would have normally crashed the program.

22.	Q: How is exception handling done?
	With the try, catch, finally and throw functions.
  
23.	Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?
	Finally is used to determine what is included.

24.	Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
An array is a collection of data that is similar that can be assessed through the index. Meaning you can only store one specific type of element/item. An array list is a collection of data, like arrays it can be similar types but also different types of data. The list size can be as large or as small as needed.

25.	Q: What is an object?
	An object is block of memory that has been made according to the code. Objects can also be stored in either a variable, in an array or collection.

26.	Q: Define constructor.
	Constructor is used to set variables to objects.
  
27.	Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
    Var can be used when the type is the same as the variable

28.	Q: What is an abstract class? An abstract class doesnâ€™t provide full abstraction but an interface does. Abstract class acts as a base for other classes while an interface is just an empty shell with only member declarations.


29.	Q: What is an interface?
	An interface holds the definitions of related functions. Must provide an implementation for each type declared.

30.	Q: What is a method?
A method is a block of code that contains statements to perform a task. Every C# program has at least one method.

31.	Q: What is a property?
Provides way to compute the value of the private field.

32.	Q: What is an access specifier? 
They determine which elements of code are able to access other variables or pieces of data.

33.	Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
	Determine how the members of the class are accessed.  

34.	Q: What is a collection?
	A collection is an easier way to work with groups of objects. It is a class so you must first declare an instance of the class before adding elements into that group. There are many different ranges of collections.


35.	Q: What is a Hash Table?
	A hash table is used for collection of key value items.
